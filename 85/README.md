# Secure Chat Application with Video Streaming

This is a secure chat application with video streaming capabilities implemented in C.

## Compilation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before compiling, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenSSL development libraries
- GTK3 development libraries 
- FFmpeg development libraries
- SDL2 development libraries
- pkg-config


On Ubuntu/Debian, you can install them with:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    libssl-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libavcodec-dev \
    libavformat-dev \
    libavutil-dev \
    libswscale-dev \
    libsdl2-dev \
    pkg-config
```

### SSL Certificate Generation

Before running the application, you need to generate SSL certificates. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

# Generate certificate signing request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

# Generate self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days)
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

# Clean up CSR as it's no longer needed
rm server.csr
```

When generating the CSR, you'll be asked several questions. You can use the following example values:
- Country Name: TW
- State/Province: Taiwan
- Locality: Taipei
- Organization: NTU
- Organizational Unit: CS
- Common Name: localhost
- Email Address: [your email]

The generated files (`server.key` and `server.crt`) should be placed in the same directory as the server executable.


## Usage Guide

### Starting the Application

1. First, start the server:
```bash
./server
```

2. Then, start the client:
```bash

### Additional Features

#### Message Types
- Broadcast messages are shown with "Sent by Relay Message"
- Direct messages are shown with "Sent by Direct Message"
- File transfers show a progress indicator

#### GUI Elements
- File transfer requests appear in a GTK window
- Video streams appear in an SDL window
- Messages are color-coded for better readability

### Error Handling
- If a user is offline, you'll receive an "User offline" message
- Failed file transfers will show appropriate error messages
- Invalid commands will prompt you to try again

### Security Features
- All communications are encrypted using SSL/TLS
- File transfers are secure and require recipient approval
- Direct messages use separate secure connections

### Tips
- Keep the server running at all times
- Make sure video files are in the correct directory
- For best performance, use video files in H.264 format
- The client must have read/write permissions in the current directory for file transfers
